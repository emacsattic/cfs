cfs-el uses the Emacs customization facilities for setting preferences.

So you can use the command @command{M-x customize-group RET cfs RET}
to access to the cfs customization group.

There are different options, but consider that there are reasonable
defaults.

Please read the CFS man pages (@command{man cattach} for example) when
the explanation of an option is not enought.
